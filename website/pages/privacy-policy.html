            <h1>Footietracker Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you utilise the services from footietracker.com (the “Service” or "Services").</p>

            <h2>1. Personal information we collect</h2>

            <h3>A. Registration</h3>

            <p>When you register an account on the Service, we will ask for a username, an email address, a password as well as a full name. The password will be hashed using the bcrypt algorithm. In addition to this, your IP address, username and/or email address will be logged during login attempts.</p>

            <h3>B. Payment processing</h3>

            <p>When submitting payment or financial information to the Service, the information will be stored on our third-party payment processor and not on our servers. We do, however, have access to basic subscriber information through our third-party payment processor.</p>

            <h3>C. Third-party services integration</h3>

            <p>Some of the main Services we provide rely on third-party services. When you allow access to link your third-party account to the Service, we will store an authentication token provided by that third-party. If you are not satisfied with the information that is available to us, you should visit the privacy settings page of that third-party. Our access from that third-party can be revoked at any time you choose.</p>

            <h2>2. How we use information</h2>

            <p>Footietracker uses the information we collect in the following ways:</p>

            <p>- Email address</p>
            <p>Your email address will be used to communicate with you and to provide you with information regarding the Services we offer and other details that may be of importance to you. Your email address will also be used to verify the legitimacy of your account.</p>

            <p>- Full name</p>
            <p>We use your full name to address you appropriately whenever we contact you.</p>

            <p>- Password</p>
            <p>Your hashed password will be used to confirm your identity during a login process.</p>

            <p>- Username</p>
            <p>Your username will be used whenever you communicate with other users via our Service.</p>

            <p>- IP address</p>
            <p>We use your IP address to prevent malicious activity on our Services.</p>

            <p>- Stripe customer ID</p>
            <p>Your Stripe customer ID will be used to associate your account with your Stripe profile so we can bill you.</p>

            <h2>3. How we share information</h2>

            <p>Your portfolio data will be shared with the same third-parties that you link to your account on our Services. For example, when you link your Google account to our Services and allow us access to Google Sheets, we will send your portfolio data to the Google API so we can consequently update your Google Sheets spreadsheet document with that data. For information on how the third-parties use your data, please refer to their respective Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>We do not use or participate in any form of advertising meaning your data will also not be used for those purposes.</p>

            <h2>4. Changes</h2>

            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>

            <h2>5. Contact us</h2>

            <p>For more information about our privacy practices, if you have questions, or if you would like to make a complaint, please contact us by emailing contact@footietracker.com.</p>
